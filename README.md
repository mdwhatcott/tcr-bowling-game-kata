# tcr-bowling-game-kata

The "Bowling Game" kata, first introduced by Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin, herein
implemented in Go using 
[TCR](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864) 
(`test && commit || revert`), a variant of TDD also codified by Kent Beck.

The TCR tool scripts I'm using, along with installation instructions, can be found here:
